# Vercel Deployment Fix - Control Plane Error

## Issue: "Control plane request failed: endpoint is disabled"

This error typically occurs when:
1. API functions aren't properly configured
2. CORS headers are missing
3. Function routing is incorrect

## Fixes Applied ✅

### 1. Simplified vercel.json Configuration
- Removed redundant API routing (Vercel handles `/api` automatically)
- Kept essential function configuration
- Simplified rewrites to only handle frontend routing

### 2. Added CORS Headers to API Functions
- Added proper CORS headers to all API endpoints
- Handles OPTIONS preflight requests
- Allows cross-origin requests from your frontend

### 3. Simplified Function Exports
- Changed from `async function` to regular `function` exports
- More reliable for Vercel serverless functions
- Proper error handling

## Test Your Fixed Deployment ✅

**1. Health Check:**
Visit: `https://[your-url]/api/ping`
Should return: JSON with status "success"

**2. Test API:**
Visit: `https://[your-url]/api/test`
Should return: JSON with endpoint info

**3. Authentication:**
POST to: `https://[your-url]/api/auth/login`
With: `{"username":"demo","password":"mybudgetmate"}`
Should return: JWT token

## Environment Variables ✅

Make sure these are set in Vercel:
```
JWT_SECRET=mybudgetmate2025secretkey!@#$%^&*()_+1234567890
STORAGE_TYPE=memory
```

## Expected Results ✅

After redeployment:
- API endpoints should respond without "Control plane" errors
- CORS errors should be resolved
- Authentication should work properly
- Frontend should communicate with API successfully

## Redeploy Instructions ✅

1. Commit and push your changes to GitHub
2. Vercel will automatically redeploy
3. Test the `/api/ping` endpoint first
4. Then test frontend login functionality

Your My Budget Mate application should now work correctly on Vercel with all API endpoints functional.
