# My Budget Mate - Deployment Status Guide

## Deployment Verification ✅

You mentioned your deployment is at `my-budget-mate-721`, but the URL might need verification.

### Check Your Deployment URL

**In your Vercel dashboard:**
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your "My Budget Mate" project
3. Look for the exact deployment URL (might be different format)

**Common Vercel URL formats:**
- `https://my-budget-mate-721.vercel.app`
- `https://my-budget-mate.vercel.app`
- `https://mybudgetmate-721.vercel.app`
- Or a custom domain if configured

### Test Your Deployment ✅

Once you have the correct URL, test these endpoints:

**1. Health Check:**
```
https://[your-url]/api/ping
```
Should return: `{"status":"success","message":"My Budget Mate API is working!"}`

**2. Frontend Access:**
```
https://[your-url]/
```
Should load the My Budget Mate login page

**3. Authentication Test:**
```
POST https://[your-url]/api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json
{"username":"demo","password":"mybudgetmate"}
```
Should return JWT token

### Environment Variables Check ✅

Make sure these are set in your Vercel dashboard:

**Required:**
```
JWT_SECRET=mybudgetmate2025secretkey!@#$%^&*()_+1234567890
STORAGE_TYPE=memory
```

### Expected Functionality ✅

Once deployed correctly, you should have:

**✅ Authentication System:**
- Login with demo credentials
- JWT token-based sessions
- User profile management

**✅ Envelope Budgeting:**
- Pre-loaded demo envelopes (Groceries, Gas, Entertainment, etc.)
- Budget tracking and management
- Envelope categorization

**✅ Transaction Management:**
- Demo transactions linked to envelopes
- Transaction creation and editing
- Transaction categorization

**✅ Account Management:**
- Demo bank accounts (ASB Everyday Account)
- Account balance tracking
- Multiple account types support

### Demo Credentials ✅

Test with these accounts:
- Username: `demo` / Password: `mybudgetmate`
- Username: `user` / Password: `demo123`
- Username: `test` / Password: `budgetmate`

### Troubleshooting ✅

**If deployment shows "NOT_FOUND":**
- Check the exact URL in your Vercel dashboard
- Verify the deployment completed successfully
- Check for any build errors in Vercel logs

**If frontend loads but shows errors:**
- Check browser console for MIME type errors (should be fixed)
- Verify API endpoints are responding
- Check environment variables are set

**If authentication fails:**
- Verify JWT_SECRET environment variable is set
- Test the `/api/ping` endpoint first
- Check network requests in browser dev tools

### Success Indicators ✅

Your deployment is working correctly when:
1. Frontend loads without JavaScript errors
2. Login with demo credentials succeeds
3. Dashboard shows demo envelopes and transactions
4. All navigation works properly
5. API endpoints respond correctly

Your My Budget Mate application is fully configured for successful deployment with all necessary fixes applied.
